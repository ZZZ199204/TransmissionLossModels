# TransmissionLossModels
There are two main folders in this repository. Both folders stand alone and their code should be run separately. 

The folder "EconomicDispatchLossApproximations" is based on the ACC paper entitled "A General Economic Dispatch Problem with Marginal Losses."  This code specifically produces the results from table I of this paper.

The folder "LossLinearizationCode" is based on the IEEE Trans. on Power Systems paper entitled "Approximating Economic Dispatch by Linearizing Transmission Losses."  This code specifically produces the results from table II of this paper.
